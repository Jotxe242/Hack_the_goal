# Hack_the_goal

This is a project developed to participate in the hackathon "Hack the Goal."
"Hack the Goal" was a hackathon where teams were looking for sustainable solutions to satisfy the enormous demand for transportation during the FIFA World Cup in Mexico.
We proposed a methodology and algorithm that, given the geographic distribution of attendees at a massive event and the location of the event, returns a set of routes that maximize the number of attendees who would use them and minimize the time they spend traveling there.
In the specific case of the problem given, Mexico has three World Cup headquarters (Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey), and all three have saturated, unstable, and inefficient transportation networks. Hosting millions of tourists would collapse these systems. Because of this, we knew it was necessary to reduce the number of private cars on the roads, so the set of routes mentioned above was planned for three types of sustainable transportation: electric buses, bicycles, and walking.
However, all of this is very expensive, and we needed to provide a solution for this as well. We then proposed a mixed financing plan between the Mexican government and private initiative: we took advantage of the government's commitment to renovate much of the public transport network into electric transport, which solves most of the acquisition costs for electric buses (the largest expense). For the remainder, we proposed allowing transport companies to purchase electric buses tax-free and giving them concessions to operate certain routes and profit from them. Additionally, we can rely on many sponsors to cover the remaining costs.
