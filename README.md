# Hack_the_goal
This is a project developed to participate in the hackathon "Hack the Goal".
"Hack the Goal" was a hackaton where the teams were looking for sustantable solutions to satisfy the enormeus demand of transportation during the Mundial of futbol in Mexico.
We proposed a metodology and algorithm that, given the geographic distribution of the assistants of a massive event and the ubication of the event, returns a set of routes that maximize the amount of assistants that would take it and minimeze the amount of time that they spend to carry there.
In the special case of the problem given, MÃ©xico has 3 mundialist headquarters (Mexico city, Guadalajara and Monterrey) and the 3 of them have a saturated, unstable and inefficient network of transport, so host a millionary amount of turists will colapse it. Because of that we knew was necesary to reduce the amount of particular cars in the red, so the set of routes said before was planned to 3 types of sustaintable ways: electric bus, bicycle and walk.
But all of this is very expensive and we should give a solution to this too, then we proposed a mixed financing plan between the mexican goverment and private initiative: we took advantage of the goverment compromise to renovate a lot of the red of public transport into electric transport so this solves the most of the adquisition of electric buses (the most of the costs), and for the rest we proposed let transport companys to buy electric buses without taxes and give them a concession to operate some routes and get benefits from it. Additionaly, we can count with many sponsors to cover the rest of the costs.
